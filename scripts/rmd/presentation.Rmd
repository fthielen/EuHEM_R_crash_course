## Introduction

- R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- Importance of R in data science: data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization.
- R's strengths: data manipulation, statistical analysis, and creating plots.

---

## Getting Started

- Installing R: https://www.r-project.org
- Installing RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
- Tour of RStudio interface: Console, script editor, environment/history, and plots/help/packages.

---

## What is R?

- R is a overgrown calculator. Try

```{r}
5 + 5 
```

---

## Task: calculate with R

Make the following assignments with R:

- Sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- 9 divided by 3
- 4 to the power of 2
- Mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

---

## Task solution: calculate with R

```{r}
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
9 / 3
4^2
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5
```

---

## When you are more advanced or after understanding these slides

```{r}
sum(1:5)
mean(1:5)
```



---

## Why RStudio?

- Integrated development environment (IDE) for R
- Provides a user-friendly interface to R
- Includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor supporting direct code execution, tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management

---

## Tweak your RStudio

- Go to: Tools > Global Options

### General
- Disable "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"
- Save workspace to .RData on exit "Never"

### Code > Editing

- Insert spaces for Tab; Tab width 8

### Code > Display
- Highlight selected line
- Show maring; Margin column 80

---

## What data types can R handle?

- numeric
```{r}
1:10
```

- character
```{r}
"foo"
```

- logical
```{r}
TRUE
```

---

## Data Structures in R

- Vectors: ordered collection of values. Use `c()` to create

```{r}
c(1, 5, 9, 3)

c("foo", "bar")

c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

---

## Data Structures in R

- Matrices: two-dimensional vectors, created with `matrix()`

```{r}
matrix(data = c("foo", "bar", "hello", "world"),
       nrow = 2,
       ncol = 2)
```

---

## Data Structures in R

Dataframes: tables where each column is a vector of the same length, but different types allowed.

```{r}
data.frame(column_a = c("foo", "bar"),
           column_b = c(1, 5))
```

---

## Data Structures in R
Lists: data structure that can contain elements of different data types like numbers, strings, vectors, and even other lists

```{r}
list(name = "John", age = 27, grades = c(80, 85, 90))
```

---

## Task: create a vector

Create a vector from:

- Number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- The words: "EuHEM", and "Summer", and "School"

---

## Task solution: create a vector

Create a vector from

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

c("EuHEM", "Summer", "School")
```

---

## Objects in R

- In R, almost everything is an object, including data items (numbers, characters), data structures (vectors, lists), and functions.

```{r}
# Creating an object
my_object <- "Hello, R!"

# Print the object
my_object

# Another object
another_object <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

another_object
```
---

## Objects in R
- Have unique names
- Always start with a letter
- May end with a number (discouraged)
- Can be separated with "." or "_" (preferred) when needed

```{r}
my_object <- "Hello, R!"

my_object

my_object <- 5

my_object
```

---

## Task: create two objects

- One with the numbers: 1, 2, 3
- Another one with numbers: 5, 4

---

## Task solution: create two objects

```{r}
obj_one <- c(1, 2, 3)

obj_two <- c(5, 4)
```
---

## Using objects
- Calculate with objects

```{r}
obj_one + 10

obj_one + obj_two
```

---

## Warnings vs Errors in R

- Errors in R: An error indicates a serious issue with your code, and the execution will be stopped immediately when an error is encountered.

```{r error=TRUE}
# Example of an error
x <- "a"
x + 1  # This will cause an error because you can't add a string and a number
```

- Warnings in R: A warning does not stop the execution of the program but indicates a possible issue in your code or the result.

```{r}
# Example of a warning
sqrt(-1)  # This will cause a warning because the square root of a negative number is not a real number in mathematics
```

---

## Handling warnings and errors
- Warnings and errors should never be ignored.
- They provide valuable information about potential problems in your code. Debugging and resolving these issues is an essential part of the coding process.
- Carefully read and understand the messages associated with warnings and errors. They often provide hints about what might be going wrong with your code.

---

## Basic Statistics in R
- R knows many build-in functions

```{r}
# Mean
mean(obj_one)

# Median
median(obj_one)
```

---

## Packages in R

- Packages in R: collection of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. They extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions for statistical analysis, graphics, etc

```{r}
# Example of installing a package
# install.packages("ggplot2")
```

---

## Loading a package
- Once a package is installed, it can be loaded into the current R session using the `library()` function.

```{r}
# Example of loading a package
library(ggplot2)
```

---

## Using a package
- After loading a package, you can use the functions provided by the package.

```{r}
# Example of using a package function
# data(mtcars)
ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg,
                   y = hp)) +
        geom_point()
```

---


## Reading data from Excel with `opensxlsx`

```{r}
library("openxlsx")

df <- openxlsx::read.xlsx(xlsxFile = here::here("data/starwars.xlsx"))
```

---

## Inspecting data

```{r}
head(df)

tail(df)

summary(df)
```

---

## Basic Data Manipulation with dplyr in R

- dplyr is a powerful package in R for data manipulation. It provides a set of "verbs" (functions) that can be used to solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

```{r}
# Install and load dplyr if you haven't already
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

```

---

## Filter
- `filter()`: Used to extract subsets of rows from a data frame.

```{r}
# Example of using filter()
dplyr::filter(.data = mtcars,
              mpg > 20)
```

---

## Select
- `select()`: Used to select variables (columns) by their names.

```{r}
# Example of using select()
dplyr::select(.data = mtcars,
              mpg, cyl, hp)
```

---

## Mutate
- `mutate()`: Used to create new variables from existing ones.

```{r}
# Example of using mutate()
dplyr::mutate(.data = mtcars,
              l_per_100km = 235.21 / mpg)
```

---

## Summarise
- `summarise()`: Used to summarise multiple values into a single value.

```{r}
# Example of using summarise()
dplyr::summarise(.data = mtcars,
                 mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
```

---

## Arrange
- `arrange()`: Used to reorder rows of a data frame.

```{r}
# Example of using arrange()
dplyr::arrange(.data = mtcars,
               desc(mpg))
```

---

## NA, NaN and other special values in R

- NA in R: NA (Not Available) is a constant in R used to represent missing or undefined data.

```{r}
# Example of NA
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
x
```

- NaN in R: NaN (Not a Number) is a constant in R used to represent the result of an undefined mathematical operation.

```{r}
# Example of NaN
0 / 0  # This will yield NaN
```

- Inf and -Inf in R: Inf and -Inf represent positive and negative infinity respectively.

```{r}
# Example of Inf and -Inf
10 / 0   # This will yield Inf
-10 / 0  # This will yield -Inf
```

- Checking for NA and NaN: `is.na()` and `is.nan()` functions can be used to check for NA and NaN values.

```{r}
# Check for NA and NaN
is.na(x)
is.nan(0 / 0)
```

- Dealing with NA and NaN: You can use `na.omit()`, `complete.cases()`, or other similar functions to deal with missing data in R.

```{r}
# Dealing with NA
na.omit(x) 
x[complete.cases(x)]
```
